import re
# ------------------ ^a...s$: any five letter string starting with a and ending with s.

# pattern = '^a...s$'
# test_string = 'abyss'
# result = re.match(pattern, test_string)

# pattern1 = '^t...h$'
# test_string1 = 'trinh'
# result = re.match(pattern1, test_string1)

# ------------------ Square brackets: Square brackets specifies a set of characters you wish to match.
pattern = '[abc]'
test_string = 'a' 
# 1 match

test_string = 'ac' 
# 2 matches

test_string = 'Hey Jude' 
# No match

test_string = 'abc de ca' 
# 5 matches

# You can also specify a range of characters using - inside square brackets.
# [a-e] is the same as [abcde]
# [1-4] is the same as [1234]
# [0-39] is the same as [01239]

# You can complement (invert) the character set by using caret ^ symbol at the start of a square-bracket.
# [^abc] means any character except a or b or c (except a except b except b).
# [^0-9] means any non-digit character.
pattern = '[^abc]'
pattern = '[^0-9]'
test_string = 'ggg' 

# ------------------ Period: A period matches any single character (except newline '\n').
# ..
# a	No match
# ac	1 match
# acd	1 match
# acde	2 matches (contains 4 characters)

# ------------------ Caret: The caret symbol ^ is used to check if a string starts with a certain character.
# ^a
# a	1 match
# abc	1 match
# bac	No match

# ^ab
# abc	1 match
# acb	No match (starts with a but not followed by b)

# ------------------ Dollar: The dollar symbol $ is used to check if a string ends with a certain character.
# a$
# a	1 match
# formula	1 match
# cab	No match

# ------------------ Star: The star symbol * matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.
# ma*n
# mn	1 match
# man	1 match
# maaan	1 match
# main	No match (a is not followed by n)
# woman	1 match

# ------------------ Plus: The plus symbol + matches one or more occurrences of the pattern left to it.
# ma+n
# mn	1 match
# man	1 match
# maaan	No match (more than one a character)
# main	No match (a is not followed by n)
# woman	1 match

# ------------------  Question Mark: The question mark symbol ? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it.
# ma?n
# mn	1 match
# man	1 match
# maaan	No match (more than one a character)
# main	No match (a is not followed by n)
# woman	1 match

# ------------------  Braces: Consider this code: {n,m}. This means at least n, and at most m repetitions of the pattern left to it.
# a{2,3}
# abc dat	No match
# abc daat	1 match (at daat)
# aabc daaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaat)
# aabc daaaat	2 matches (at aabc and daaaat)

# ------------------  Braces: Let's try one more example. This RegEx [0-9]{2, 4} matches at least 2 digits but not more than 4 digits
# [0-9]{2,4}
# ab123csde	1 match (match at ab123csde)
# 12 and 345673	3 matches (12, 3456, 73)
# 1 and 2	No match

# ------------------  Alternation: Vertical bar | is used for alternation (or operator).
# a|b
# de	No match
# ade	1 match (match at ade)
# acdbea	3 matches (at acdbea)

# ------------------  Group: Parentheses () is used to group sub-patterns. For example, (a|b|c)xz match any string that matches either a or b or c followed by xz
# (a|b|c)xz
# ab xz	No match
# abxz	1 match (match at abxz)
# axz cabxz	2 matches (at axzbc cabxz)

# ------------------  Backslash: Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters.
# For example,
# \$a match if a string contains $ followed by a. Here, $ is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.
# If you are unsure if a character has special meaning or not, you can put \ in front of it. This makes sure the character is not treated in a special way.

# ------------------  Special Sequences: 
# Special sequences make commonly used patterns easier to write. Here's a list of special sequences:
# ------- \A - Matches if the specified characters are at the start of a string.
# \Athe

# In the sun	No match

# ------ \b - Matches if the specified characters are at the beginning or end of a word.
# \bfoo	
# football	Match
# a football	Match
# afootball	No match

# foo\b	
# the foo	Match
# the afoo test	Match
# the afootest	No match

# ------ \B - Opposite of \b. Matches if the specified characters are not at the beginning or end of a word.
# \Bfoo	football	No match
# a football	No match
# afootball	Match

# foo\B	the foo	No match
# the afoo test	No match
# the afootest	Match

# ------ \d - Matches any decimal digit. Equivalent to [0-9]

# PythonRegEx	No match

# ------ \S - Matches where a string contains any non-whitespace character. Equivalent to [^ \t\n\r\f\v].
# \S	a b	2 matches (at  a b)
# (empty) 	No match

# ------ \w - Matches any alphanumeric character (digits and alphabets). Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. By the way, underscore _ is also considered an alphanumeric character.

# Tip: To build and test regular expressions, you can use RegEx tester tools such as https://regex101.com/. This tool not only helps you in creating regular expressions, but it also helps you learn it.
result = re.match(pattern, test_string)
if result:
  print("Match found.")
else:
  print("No match found.")	
# Python RegEx
# Python has a module named re to work with regular expressions. To use it, we need to import the module. import re
# ------------------ re.findall(): The re.findall() method returns a list of strings containing all matches.
# Example 1: re.findall()
# Program to extract numbers from a string

import re

string = 'hello 12 hi 89. Howdy 34'
pattern = '\d+'

result = re.findall(pattern, string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['12', '89', '34']
# If the pattern is not found, re.findall() returns an empty list.

# ------------------ re.split(): The re.split method splits the string where there is a match and returns a list of strings where the splits have occurred.
# Example 2: re.split()

import re

string = 'Twelve:12 Eighty nine:89.'
pattern = '\d+'

result = re.split(pattern, string) 
print(result)

# You can pass maxsplit argument to the re.split() method. It's the maximum number of splits that will occur.
import re

string = 'Twelve:12 Eighty nine:89 Nine:9.'
pattern = '\d+'

# maxsplit = 1
# split only at the first occurrence
result = re.split(pattern, string, 1) 
print(result)

# Output: ['Twelve:', ' Eighty nine:89 Nine:9.']
# By the way, the default value of maxsplit is 0; meaning all possible splits.

# Output: ['Twelve:', ' Eighty nine:', '.']
# If the pattern is not found, re.split() returns a list containing the original string.

# ------------------ re.sub(): The method returns a string where matched occurrences are replaced with the content of replace variable.

# The syntax of re.sub() is:
# re.sub(pattern, replace, string)

# Example 3: re.sub()
# Program to remove all whitespaces
import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'

# empty string
replace = ''

new_string = re.sub(pattern, replace, string) 
print(new_string)

# Output: abc12de23f456

# If the pattern is not found, re.sub() returns the original string.

# You can pass count as a fourth parameter to the re.sub() method. If omited, it results to 0. This will replace all occurrences.

import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'
replace = ''

new_string = re.sub(r'\s+', replace, string, 1) 
print(new_string)

# Output:
# abc12de 23
# f45 6

# ------------------ re.subn(): The re.subn() is similar to re.sub() expect it returns a tuple of 2 items containing the new string and the number of substitutions made.

# Example 4: re.subn()

# Program to remove all whitespaces
import re

# multiline string
string = 'abc 12\
de 23 \n f45 6'

# matches all whitespace characters
pattern = '\s+'

# empty string
replace = ''

new_string = re.subn(pattern, replace, string) 
print(new_string)

# Output: ('abc12de23f456', 4)

# ------------------ re.search(): The re.search() method takes two arguments: a pattern and a string. The method looks for the first location where the RegEx pattern produces a match with the string.
# If the search is successful, re.search() returns a match object; if not, it returns None.

# match = re.search(pattern, str)

# Example 5: re.search()

import re

string = "Python is fun"

# check if 'Python' is at the beginning
match = re.search('\APython', string)

if match:
  print("pattern found inside the string")
else:
  print("pattern not found")  

# Output: pattern found inside the string
# Here, match contains a match object.

# ------------------ Match object:
# You can get methods and attributes of a match object using dir() function.

# Some of the commonly used methods and attributes of match objects are:
# --------- match.group(): The group() method returns the part of the string where there is a match.

# Example 6: Match object

import re

string = '39801 356, 2102 1111'

# Three digit number followed by space followed by two digit number
pattern = '(\d{3}) (\d{2})'

# match variable contains a Match object.
match = re.search(pattern, string) 

if match:
  print(match.group())
else:
  print("pattern not found")

# Output: 801 35

# Here, match variable contains a match object.
# Our pattern (\d{3}) (\d{2}) has two subgroups (\d{3}) and (\d{2}). You can get the part of the string of these parenthesized subgroups. Here's how:

match.group(1)
# '801'

match.group(2)
# '35'
match.group(1, 2)
# ('801', '35')

match.groups()
# ('801', '35')

# --------- match.start(), match.end() and match.span(): The start() function returns the index of the start of the matched substring. Similarly, end() returns the end index of the matched substring.
# >>> match.start()
# 2
# >>> match.end()
# 8

# The span() function returns a tuple containing start and end index of the matched part.

# >>> match.span()
# (2, 8)

# --------- match.re and match.string: The re attribute of a matched object returns a regular expression object. Similarly, string attribute returns the passed string.
# >>> match.re
# re.compile('(\\d{3}) (\\d{2})')

# >>> match.string
# '39801 356, 2102 1111'

# We have covered all commonly used methods defined in the re module. If you want to learn more, visit Python 3 re module. https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

# ------------------ Using r prefix before RegEx: 

# When r or R prefix is used before a regular expression, it means raw string. For example, '\n' is a new line whereas r'\n' means two characters: a backslash \ followed by n.

# Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. However, using r prefix makes \ treat as a normal character.

# Example 7: Raw string using r prefix

import re

string = '\n and \r are escape sequences.'

result = re.findall(r'[\n\r]', string) 
print(result)

# Output: ['\n', '\r']
