1
What query would you run to get all of the users?
SELECT * 
FROM users;

2
What query would you run to only get the first names of all of the users?
SELECT first_name 
FROM users;

3
What query would you run to only get the first and last names of all of the users?
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM users;

SELECT w/ Conditionals

4
What query would you run to only get the first name of users with id of 2?
SELECT first_name
FROM users
WHERE id = 2;

5
What query would you run to get the last names of users with id of 2 or 3?
SELECT last_name
FROM users
WHERE id = 2 OR id = 3;

6
What query would you run to get all of the users with id greater than 2?
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE id > 2;

7
What query would you run to get all of the users with id less than or equal to 3?
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE id <= 3;

8
What query would you run to get all of the users with first names ending in "e"?
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "%e";

9
What query would you run to get all of the users with first names starting in "K"?
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "K%";


SELECT w/ Sorting

10
What query would you run to get all of the users with the youngest users at the top of the table?
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY birthday DESC;

11
What query would you run to get all of the users with the oldest users at the top of the table?
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY birthday ASC;

12
What query would you run to get all of the users with the first name that ends with "e" with the youngest users at the top of the table?
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE first_name LIKE "%e"
ORDER BY birthday DESC;

13
What query would you run to get only the first names of all of the users in alphabetical order?
SELECT first_name
FROM users
ORDER BY first_name;
The default for ORDER BY is ASC so we can leave that part out if we want the sorting to be ascending.

SELECT w/ LIMIT and OFFSET

14
What query would you run to get the first 3 users?
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 3;

15
What query would you run to get user records 3-5?
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 3
OFFSET 2;

16
You could also combine LIMIT and OFFSET like this:
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 2,3;

World

18
The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in 'single quotes';
Modify it to show the population of Germany
SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'

19
Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.
Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.
SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

20
Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000

You should include Mexico City as it is longer than Mexico. You should not include Luxembourg as the capital is the same as the country.
SELECT capital, name
FROM world
