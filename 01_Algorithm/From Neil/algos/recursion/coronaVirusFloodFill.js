/* 
  Given 
    - a 2d array representing a social space as a grid
      Each grid space either has a string representing a person's name,
      or null if there is no person there
    - a point object {x: int, y: int} indicating where "patient zero" is in the grid

  return an array of all the names of the people who that corona virus will spread to due to not social distancing
  

  There will be exactly one grid space with the value "patient zero" that
  represents someone infected.

  Standing next to someone means there is someone in the grid space immediately
  above, below, left, or right. Infection cannot directly spread diagonally.

  Someone is social distancing if the grid space above, below, left, and right are null or
  there is no space next to them.

  For simplicity sake (not technically true) let's assume if a person is standing
  next to someone who is or becomes infected, they will also become infected.

  Find everyone who corona virus will spread to starting from "patient zero" as the virus spreads outward.
